# Escape to Eclipse

**The Story is set in the year 2453:**

**Beginning:**

Earth has become uninhabitable after centuries of poor political decisions, 
resulting in an environment that no longer allows humanity to live safely.

In desperation, people band together to build a spaceship in search of salvation in the vastness of space.

You and your crew are sent out to find a way to escape this universe and establish a new bastion for humanity.

**Tutorial:**

System: [Choose your rank system]  
System: [Enter your name]  
System: [Enter your spaceship's name]

[Rank-1]: Hello [Rank] [Name], welcome aboard our spaceship [Ship Name].  
[Rank-1]: All systems are maintained, fully operational, and the crew awaits your orders.

[Rank]: Fuel and power supply?  
[Rank-1]: Maximum capacity reached and functioning flawlessly.  
[Rank]: Very good.
Relay the orders to the crew, we launch at eight hundred ship time.  
[Rank-1]: At your command.

System: And so you set off into the unknown, the last hope of humanity.

---

**eighteen hundred ship time, ten hours after launch:**

System: M800 cryo-tanks ready, no malfunctions. Repair, surveillance, and command drones are active.  
[Rank-1]: Everything is prepared, [Rank]. Neural interfaces have been implanted in the crew, allowing them to fulfill their tasks even under the hibernation protocol, ensuring optimal control of drone operations.  
[Rank]: Very well. Relay the command to activate hibernation protocol.

System: WARNING, hibernation protocol initiated. To the crew, please proceed immediately to your cryo-chambers.  
[Rank-1]: Sleep well, [Rank]. See you at zero hundred ship time.  
[Rank]: Good night, [Rank-1]. I’ll monitor the process before entering my M1000.Command.KT.

---

**twenty hundred ship time, twelve hours after launch:**

You enter your cabin, where a sarcophagus-like construct with several steel protective layers stands in the center. After entering several passwords on a wall console, the steel shielding retracts, revealing layers of tubes, cables, injectors, and other components essential for entering, sustaining, and ending cryo-sleep.

Two more inputs, and these layers vanish inside the machine, revealing a tank with a padded backrest and base, which opens slowly with a quiet hiss. You lie down, put on a supply mask, and press the activation button. The structure closes, and multiple injectors and bridging cables connect with your implanted interfaces.

After a few seconds of darkness, you see through the optics of the command drone on the bridge.

**[Tutorial - Controls]**

On the bridge, several red lights flash, and the proximity alarm blares with a loud siren.  
[Rank-1]: Enemy contact! Multiple unidentified spacecraft on the scanner.  
[Rank]: Impossible! Humanity has never ventured into this quadrant.

The ship shudders under a series of violent impacts.  
[Rank-1]: We’re under fire!  
[Rank]: Divert all power to the engines, try to evade them!  
[Rank-1]: We’re too slow; we can’t escape! Multiple vital system components are offline!

[Rank]: Change course to U.150.200, immediately!

---

**Direction Explanation:**

- Height Direction:  
  - N = Neutral  
  - U = Down  
  - O = Up  

- Width/Rotation Direction:  
  - From the bridge (0 degrees) given in a rightward angle.  
  - Units (degrees), e.g., 120, maximum 360.

- Distance:  
  - Always in SI units (meters), e.g., 200.

[Rank-1]: Into the asteroid field?!  
[Rank]: It’s our only chance!  
[Rank-1]: Acknowledged, course change in 5 seconds!

As you navigate through the asteroid field towards a planet below, the ship begins to lose more system functions due to collisions, and soon, the controls fail entirely.  
[Rank]: Activate emergency lockdown; we’re going down!

After a brutal crash landing, everything goes black. The command drone must have been destroyed on impact.

---

**zero hundred ship time, 24 hours after launch:**

You awaken, feeling intense pain throughout your body. The system responds to your awakening with a yellow glow, altering your infusion dosage from life-saving to pain-relieving. After several agonizing moments, the pain finally subsides, allowing you to process the system's alert.

System: ... therefore immediate action is required.  
[Rank]: Repeat statement.  
System: Multiple system components are destroyed, life support is critical, and seven crew members show no life signs. The ship has crashed and cannot maneuver. I cannot repair the damage; immediate action is required.

[Rank]: Increase my adrenaline stimulant, administer a “Last Man Standing” dose, and initiate the Protector protocol. Open my capsule and prepare the defensive equipment.

---

**Definition - “Last Man Standing”**

“Last Man Standing” is a special cocktail of stimulants, painkillers, and drugs developed by scientists for extreme emergencies involving severe injuries. Although classified as safe, it has side effects such as exhaustion, heightened aggression, or paranoia after its effects wear off. It enhances wound healing, removes the need for sleep, and boosts speed and reflexes.

---

System: As you wish.

As you step out of your capsule, you stand on a platform with mechanical arms and mounts that quickly equip you with the MK 2 Commander Protector armor. The platform hands you your Delta-Predator, a fully automatic assault rifle, caliber 6. Equipped, you begin to explore your surroundings.

Suddenly, a spider-like creature with huge mandibles bursts from beneath you. You dodge with a leap, but the creature charges.  

After a long fight, you defeat the attacker and continue your search for the crew. You stumble upon a massive alien spaceship graveyard and mark its location, hoping to use parts to repair your ship.

After rescuing your crew, you start burying the fallen, salvaging parts from the wreckage, and repairing the ship. You manage to incorporate some of the alien weaponry into [Ship Name].

**zero hundred ship time, 528 hours after launch:**

**[Shipyard Tutorial]**

After several attempts, the machines hum back to life, and [Ship Name] rises once more towards orbit. As it heads through the path cleared by your crash in the asteroid belt, the unknown ships reappear on your radar.

[Rank]: All hands to battle stations!  
[Combat Tutorial - Space]  
[System]: You have completed the tutorial. Good luck saving humanity.

---

**End of the Game:**

You have fully upgraded your engines and power supply, and you are now able to escape our universe through the Eclipse.

[Rank-1] Congratulations, [Rank].

[Rank] You will stay behind to defend the Finals End Station, send a message toward Earth, and modify the incoming ships in the shipyard to ensure their smooth transition.

[Rank-1] But why should I stay behind? Haven't I always served you faithfully, [Rank]?

[Rank] You must ensure humanity's survival, and don't worry—you will follow with the newly modified ships.

[Rank-1] At your command. Thank you, [Rank].

[Rank] See you on the other side, [Rank-1].

[Rank-1] See you on the other side, [Rank].

Then, you board the [Ship Name] and set off into the Eclipse.

**[System] Congratulations, you have completed Escape to Eclipse.**
